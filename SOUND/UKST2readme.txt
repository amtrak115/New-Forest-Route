Thankyou for downloading these files.

IMPORTANT
~~~~~~~~~
This Sound Upgrade Set results in a more complex sound configuration than the MSTS original, requiring more of your systems resources. Hence only one Scalability Level has been implimented rather than the three levels used by MS/Kuju.

ONLY INSTALL IF YOUR SOUND LEVEL IN THE MAIN MSTS SOUND SETUP MENU IS SET TO HIGH AND MSTS PERFORMS TO YOUR SATISFACTION.

Converting a Route to UKSteamTrack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2. In the routes main folder rename the existing ttype.dat file to ttype.old
3. Copy from the main Sound folder the new ttype.dat file and paste it into the routes main folder


Flange Squeal Feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Of the original MSTS Track Sound Regions only the "Default" and "Wooden Supported" ones have been modified to include the flange squeals, which are essentially the same sounds in both.

The new "wooden supported" Track Sound Region requires placement in a route using the Route Editor. These sounds are different from the "Default" and "Wooden Supported" sounds, being much more like groans and creaks.

In all regions Squeals play only below 20mph, fading out between 10mph and 20mph.
