Discs - use headcode files from common headcodes
Lamps - add LMS_Headlamp individually


RF_BR_4F
Can not be changed.
All locos are carrying S&D passenger headcode.
Would need to contact RF to get model without lamps.


BR Modified Hall
Existing lamps are 'Express Passenger' (15) - they could possibly be alphaed out to allow changing lamp code.


BR 30316 (ex LSWR 700 class) - my model - could export a version without discs.


BR_AdamsRadial - individual discs or lamps could be added.


BR_T9 - individual discs or lamps can be added


BR 30093 (ex LSWR B4) - individual discs or lamps can be added - shunting lamps??


CCW_BR_Q - all disc codes available in common.headcodes, lamps can be added individually


CCW_BR_U - common.headcodes has discs 01, 06, 11, 15 and 19 only; other discs could be added to make other combinations and lamps need to be added individually
