![NewForestRoute](/NfGit.jpg)

  Is a work in progress.
  
 A self-contained route for Open Rails. It features the Bournemouth UK Railway line in the 1950s.
 The route focus is on the historical timetable included
The route Uses included custom files such as the Open Rails Version, tsection, and rolling stock mods. It may not run outside of the included files.
Keep the mini route separate from any existing MSTS or ORTS installation
Attempts to recreate the 1950s timetable for Open Rails Timetable mode.
The route is freeware, but uses rolling stock provided by others. Copyright remains with rolling stock authors, and they have my thanks.
Some non - fatal errors exist. These will gradually be reduced. Some errors are a MSTS legacy, and must be tolerated.
