A British ‘Rail’ Modeling Project by Joseph Pearson (buckeye).  The new rail project was started to create a more varied look to the track work and ballast available for myself and to the route builders of MSTS.  
Intended as individual track pieces the BR_Project would complement Tim Booth’s UKFS track system, although full track layout’s would be possible if enough track pieces where available.
At present there is 83MB of track shapes available to download, but it must be emphasized that the tsection.dat file must be tsection.dat 40 or above (included).

Textures: two main texture files of 1024 and 128 size are used for the track system with a DXT1 compression and based around the 18 meter (36 foot) length of track for the bullhead rail, flatbottom rail will follow at a similar length to suite the texture files. 
Ballast of differing sorts will exist together with no loss of frame rate ensuring continuation of the train sim.
