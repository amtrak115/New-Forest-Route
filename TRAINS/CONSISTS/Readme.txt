Lydbrook Junction 2 Stock
Ex Great Western Railway ( Swindon built ) diesel railcar No 29
Version 1.0 ( February 2011 )

3D Model built by Reg Furniss

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This 3D model has been built using TrainSim Modeler

Railcars were used on the Wye Valley lines ( No. 30 ) and were tried out on other Forest routes.
This model is of No.29, in early BR livery.
I have included my attempt at a cabview, please feel free to change it if you like.
The loco is fully BIN ready, but I have included a non-BIN eng. file for those who have not yet
installed this addition to the game.  Just copy the eng. file from the NON-BIN folder and paste it
into the main folder, let it over write the original. 

Any suggestions of help or constructive comments welcome.

1.	You must give credit to all parties involved in the development and retain this readme in any repacking of the repainted wagon.
