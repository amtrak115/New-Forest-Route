exLMS Steel End 5 Plank Open Wagons

Model and Textures by Ian Macmillan.
Version 3 beefs up the brake gear and adds 3D springes and other minor tweeks.


PROTOTYPE.
~~~~~~~~~~

The pressed steel end version of the LMS standard 5 plank wagon first appeared in 1933 when 100 were built.

No further wagons were built until 1946 when 3550 wagons were built to diagram 2110. These were unfitted with 4 shoe brakes but 300 had the LMS design of 8 shoe fitted brake and additional coil suspension.
These continued to be built until 1948.

A new diagram, 2150, was then issued. This was to cover minor changes in plank size but this change not noticable.
These wagons were built under BR ownership until 1952.

Almost all the unfitted wagons soon recieved vacuum cylinders and many were given tarpaulin bars. 
In the 60s most of the bars were removed.

The wagons became redundant in the 60s and were turned over to the engineers where they were used to carry ballast and spoil. Some lasted until the early 90s until replaced by air braked wagons.

THE MODELS.
~~~~~~~~~~~

I have made 3 exLMS/BR wagons with 4shoe, and  8shoe fitted brakes and an unfitted one.

These come empty and with various loads but if you look in the folder you will find additional loaded wagons.


These models may not be posted on any website or included on CD without written permission.
Please also obtain permission for repaints. This will usually be granted, I just want to avoid duplication.
