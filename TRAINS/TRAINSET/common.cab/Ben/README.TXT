INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

To install this cab view to any steam locomotive:

1. Unzip the contents onto your desktop. 

2. Use the auto installer to install the cab view into the common.cab directory.  Please be aware that this will overwrite any previous versions of this cab.

3. Replace the cab view entry of the .eng file of the locomotive with the following line:
	CabView ( "..\\..\\common.cab\\Ben\\Ben.cvf" )

WARNING: If you wish to remove or replace this cab view please amend the CabView line of the .eng file as appropriate before removing or replacing the CabView folder or any of its contents.
