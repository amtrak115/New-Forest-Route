Cab view for King Arthur Class Locos. Ver 3.0 May 2011

Corrected Firebox.Day & Night views added for use with MSBin.
Many thanks to Len Renwick for providing the correct firebox pics.

Installation:- Unzip to a folder of your own choice. Copy (right click)the cab view folder and paste it into the loco folder you wish to use it on.Either overwrite the original cabview folder or if you prefer to keep the original as well, rename it to Cabviewold prior to the paste operation.

To get it to work in that particular loco modify the eng file cab view entry to read KA.cvf
as below

	SteamBlowerEffectExponent( 0.9 )
	SteamBlowerEfficiencyExponent( 1.1 )
	SteamBlowerMaxSteamUsageRate( 500 )	comment( lbs/h )
	SteamBlowerMaxProportionOfBlastEffect( 0.13 )

	SteamSmokeUnitsPerPoundOfFuel( 5.8 )

	CabView ( KA.cvf )           (THIS IS THE LINE TO MODIFY)
