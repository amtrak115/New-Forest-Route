Thank you for downloading this cab view.

This cabview is a much mucked about version of the std. Scotsman cab, it has been altered
to represent the front cab spectacles as seen on the Fowler type steam locomotives.
The side views represent a typical tank or tender loco 

There are two cab views avalable in this download.
A version suitable for LMSR Fowler tank locomotives ie: 3F ( jinty ) and " Dock Tank "
A version suitable for LMSR Fowler tender locomotives ie: 2P - 4F and 7F 

The cabs are designed to be used in the common cab folder.  


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

To install the cab view to the selected locomotive.

1. Unzip the contents of this folder to a safe place. 

2. Copy and paste the "RF_Fowler_Cabs" folder into the common.cab directory.  Please be aware that this will overwrite any previous versions of this cab.

3. Replace the cab view entry of the .eng file of your locomotive with the following line:
   For Fowler tank engines
	CabView ( "..\\..\\common.cab\\RF_Fowler_Cabs\\FOWLER_TANK_CAB.cvf" )
   For Fowler tender engines
      CabView ( "..\\..\\common.cab\\RF_Fowler_Cabs\\FOWLER_TENDER_CAB.cvf" )

WARNING: If you wish to remove or replace this cab view please amend the CabView line of the .eng file as appropriate before removing or replacing the CabView folder or any of its contents.
