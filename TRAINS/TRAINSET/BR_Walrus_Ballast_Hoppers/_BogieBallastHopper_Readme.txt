Bogie Ballast Hopper.

The LSWR had no good source of ballast in the London area and had to obtain it from over 100 miles away in Dartmoor.
To move this ballast 20 40 ton bogie hoppers were introduced in 1903. They had vacuum brakes and were intended to run at 60 MPH. Botton doors were fitted which discharged between the rails operated from ground level.

The Southern adopted the basic design in 1928 but moved the operation of the doors to a platform on one end of the wagon and added side discharge and full hight sides. 25 were built and given Southern Diagram 1772.
In 1936 22 Diagram 1774 added door controls at both ends and increased the slope of the hopper end.
Prolonged running a 60 MPH took its toll on the bogie springs and 
20 more were built in 1947 to Digram 1775 with American AAR bogies and a further increase to the end slope.

BR addopted the design with 50 wagons built in 1952 to D585.
The body was the same as D1775 but the BR plate frame bogie was fitted.

Livery was black with yellow lettering.
After the introduction of the BR wagons most of the SR wagons were re-allocated, many going to Scotland.
Withdrawal started in the early 70s but most survived until the end of vacuum brakes in the 80s with some living on in private ownership.
