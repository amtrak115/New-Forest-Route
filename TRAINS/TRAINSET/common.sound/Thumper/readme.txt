Thank you for downloading this file.

This is the best I can do at the moment but personally I think it sounds a bit more realistic
than the current ones. Anyone is welcome to play around with them and upload a new and improved version of them.

1. Make a back up of your old Thumper sounds that are located in the common.sound folder in the TRAINSET folder.
These are the sounds you get when you download The original Thumper sounds.
2. Now copy and paste all the files which are included in this zip file into the Thumper folder
which is located in the common.sound folder.
3. Now try them out and see if they are any better. If not, just copy and paste the files
from your back up folder into the Thumper folder where you had previously put my sounds.

Hope you like them.

Any problems just pm me on forums. My username is phat2003uk
