HISTORY
~~~~~~~
The first BR banana vans had been a continuation of the LMS type and it was not until 1959 that a new design, based on the standard van, appeared.
When the use of rail began to decrease these vans spent a lot of time in store but because their steam heating meant that they were well sealed, this also kept the damp out and they became popular as stores vans. Some can still be found in internal use today.
