Lydbrook Junction 2 Stock
Auto-trailers Nos. 103 and 220
Version 1.0 ( February 2011 )

3D Model built by Reg Furniss

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This 3D model has been built using TrainSim Modeler

Auto-trailers were used on the Lydney to Cinderford lines and were tried out on other Forest routes.
These models are of a series 53 auto-trailer in WW2 maroon and early BR livery.
Auto-trailers were generally used in conjunction with the 14xx Class of tank engine'
The great advantage of the " auto-train " was the absence of the need to "run the engine round" before
making the return trip as a special compartment in the trailer allowed the train to be driven from there. 

Any suggestions of help or constructive comments welcome.
