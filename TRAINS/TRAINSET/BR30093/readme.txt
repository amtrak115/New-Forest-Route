Thank you for using this model.
The model was built using 3Dcanvas v6.0.0.3, including many plug-ins written by Paul Gausden ("Decapod"); and Paint Shop Pro v7.0.

This locomotive requires the "2 cylinder sound set"
by Stuart Williamson for its sound: you may download this from UKTS.-ID=2910

Dave Forrest's crew alias UKTS-ID=11890 may also be used.

Default "Scotsman" cab views are called up, but many users will prefer to use alternative tank engine data!

This model is for your personal use only, and may not be sold or distributed in any way.

The HISTORY of the PROTOTYPE.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 LSWR B4 Class, 0-4-0 tank engines designed by William Adams for shunting work, the B4 is best known for its work at Southampton and other dockyards. The last was withdrawn in 1963, but one is preserved as "Normandy" on the Bluebell Railway".



INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, it is suggested that you make a copy of all the files in the \TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

Files included are:

This 	readme.txt
	loco.ace

	br30093.eng

	br30093.s
	br30093.sd

	B4prof2.ACE
	B4cab.ACE
	BR_B4_30093.ACE 

Step 1. In the \TRAINS\TRAINSET directory, create a new Folder called BR30093.

Step 2. Now copy/extract all the files in the archive into this directory, keeping the folder option turned on.

Step3. A CABVIEW folder including just scotsman.cvf is included as a default.



You are now ready to create a consist containing this model by using the Activity Editor supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the rolling stock that you have available. By default it has Chain couplings.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
