GWR 5700 and 8750 Class Pannier tanks, the former were first introduced in 1929 by C.B. Collett.  They were to replace the ageing pannier and saddle tanks of Armstrong and Dean era and were designed for general shunting, local freight and passenger duties.  The 8750 class were introduced in 1933 and had some improvements including an updated cab. Most survived up to the mid sixties and several of the class have been preserved.
