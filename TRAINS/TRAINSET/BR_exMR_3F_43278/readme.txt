Thank you for using this model, which is supplied for your personal use only, and may not be sold or distributed in any way other than as a Freeware item from UKTrainsim.com.

The model may be included in Freeware route CD packages, but only by specific prior written permission.

Reskins in any form are specifically prohibited.  NO permissions will be given.


This version is fairly clean BR unlined early crest livery.  Others will be available.  

Originally built for the excellent Skipton to Carlisle CD by Paul Mitchell, solely for MR livery, it (and Paul!) suffered my modifications to LMSR livery/condition for the LMSR CD.  If that wasn't enough punishment, it's now had further Mods to BR condition by me. (so you know who to blame!!)

Version 2 adds more accurate .eng file settings by Rick Gibb, and also better lighting effects by him.

WARNING: This model has manual Damper control in Auto Firing, so open the dampers before setting off or pay the consequences with poor draught and so poor steaming!!!




THE REAL THING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a model of the classic Midland "Pickup Goods" 0-6-0 as running late 50s with BR. Vacuum fitted, they were often used for passenger turns, just like their 4F sisters. 

The Class comprised Johnson 2F rebuilds (Odd numbers within the range 3136-3764), and Johnson/Deeley 3F's in the range 3765-3834, with the usual 4 in front where they lasted into BR days


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~


This model as uploaded uses the Period Metal Tender Cab, as made by me for the Skipton to Carlisle CD, and so is NOT included.  Feel free to alter the cab used to your preference if you are able, I will probably now in the absence of this CD upload the cab to UKTrainsim.com.

This model also needs the 2 Cyl Loco Sounds available from UKTrainsim.com as File ID 2910. 

Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.
   

To install, Extract all the files in the archive into your Train Simulator folder, keeping the folder option turned on.  


A Light Engine Consist is provided, so load up MSTS and go drive it...............


Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the rolling stock that you have available. By default it has Chain couplings.


WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
