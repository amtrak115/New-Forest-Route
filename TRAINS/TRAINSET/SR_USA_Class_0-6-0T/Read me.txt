***************************************************

These ungainly and very un-British looking locomotives came to the Southern Railway, where they performed sterling service, as a result of WWII.

In 1942 the United States Army Transportation Corps had these shunting tanks and the class S-160 2-8-0 heavy goods locomotives built by various American builders for use in post-invasion Europe. As these locomotives were shipped to England, some were stored and some used in the build up to D-Day. The 0-6-0 tanks were powerful and, due to their short coupled wheelbase, able to manoueuvre in tight areas.
