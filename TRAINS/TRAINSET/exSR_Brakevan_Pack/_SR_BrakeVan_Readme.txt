PROTOTYPE
~~~~~~~~~~
The three companies which made up the Southern had all built reasonably modern brakevans after the great war but by the grouping in 1923, heavier trains meant there was a need to replace the older low weight vans.

The first SR van was a repeat order of the SECR "Dancehall" van to Diagram 1560.
The lack of duckets displeased the LSWR men but they were placated by the purchase of 20 LSWR designed vans from the War Department.

The first truely Southern van emerged in 1937 and was unlike any brakevan see before.
It had the underframe of the SECR van but the body was only 14feet long with a 7ft 6in cabin. Some might say that the designers had listened to complaints that the Dancehalls were too big to heat and over-reacted with a cabin that was too hot in summer. Sceptics would say it was cheaper. Almost everthing on the Southern had a nic-name and they were soon dubbed pill-boxes.
Duckets were provided on the left hand side of the cabin and sandboxes were fitted on the end platform. 70 were built to diagram 1578.
A flaw in the design was that the door opened against the guard's seat.
This was corrected by Diagram 1579 which mirrored the design with the duckets now on the right. Changes were also made to the brake rigging and the step hangers.
this became the standard van with construction lasting from 1928 until 1941
A minor change in 1940 added an extra end window and 2+2 planking. Many early vans recieved the extra window in later life.
In 1947 a new diagram 1582 was issued. This had altered brake gear, another additional window, but did not have a sandbox.

In 1932 a 15ton van was introduced to replace elderly vans used on lightly laid branch lines. This was similar to D 1579 but had a shallower underframe. It was given D1581. They were allocated to specific duties and rarely strayed from their home depots.

Meanwhile, the trend towards fast fitted goods saw a need for a fitted van. The current underframe did not have the space for a vacuum cylinder so a new design was required.
In 1933 Twenty redundant motor luggage vans were rebuilt with a shortened body and end balconies and the result was a bogie van ideal for fast running and given diagram 1580.
A second batch of 25 was built from new in 1934. This had a shortened carriage underframe and a slightly longer version of the standard body. Their size gained them the nic-name of Queen Marys.
 

After WW2 it became difficult to supply dry sand and BR removed the sandboxes from  the 4 wheeled vans. They remained unused on the bogie vans probably because removal was more trouble than it was worth. 
THe 15 ton vans lasted until the Beeching era when the pick-up goods and branch lines they worked were axed.
Most of the 25T vans remained until unfitted trains were done away with in the 80s.
The bogie conversions were withdrawn in the late 50s but 5 were re-instated for use by the engineers and lived on a further 10 years.
The new build bogie vans lived on beyond even the end of unfitted working and the need for a brake van. Many recieving air brakes. Some went to the engineers while others were used for special duties.
several have been preserved. 

Like locomotives, brake vans stuck to their owning companies lines.
When BR took over the SR vans traveled further but old habits remained and most returned to the Southern region.
