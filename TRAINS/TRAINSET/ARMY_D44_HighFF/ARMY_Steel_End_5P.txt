PROTOTYPE.
~~~~~~~~~~

In 1963 42 wagons to BR diagram 44 were built for the army. These had the LMS design of 8 shoe brake but did not have the additional springs and were fitted with hydraulic buffers.
The wagons continued in use until the 1980s.

Please also obtain permission for repaints. This will usually be granted, I just want to avoid duplication.
