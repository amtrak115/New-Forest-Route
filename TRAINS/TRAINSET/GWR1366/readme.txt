Thankyou for downloading this model.

The class 1366 loco was used mainly for shunting and short passenger duties. It was built in the mid 1930's to replace the aging 1361 class saddle tanks.

The Cab and sounds for this model are aliased to the scotsman to save space.

This model is for your personal use only, and may not be sold or distributed in any way.

This model is highly detailed, but I have made an effort to reduce the number of polygons. It weighs in at 5336 Polygons, but contains 6 distance levels and drops 2000 polygons at over 100m, so it will make an ideal AI loco maintaining good framerates.
