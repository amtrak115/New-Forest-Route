LNER diagram 158 Long wheelbase Brakevan.

Model :    Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.


A follow up from the first design ( D61 - UKTS file 13727 ), these vans were weighted up to 20 tons by fitting concrete blocks on the end balcony and between the frames rather than the scrap rails used earlier. This was due to wartime steel shortages.
The rails had stiffened the underframe and it was found nessesary to add a small brace.

These vans were were still being built at nationalisation. The final batch being given BR numbers and the BR diagram D500.

This model comes as versions with no tail lamp, a tail lamp for fitted trains, tail and side lamps for unfitted. These show a white lamp forward to ensure the driver that his train is complete in darkness. A fully detailed interior with a nice warm fire is included. You can view this with the key 5 camera.
