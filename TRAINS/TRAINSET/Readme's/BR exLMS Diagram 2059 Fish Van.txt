HISTORY
~~~~~~~
One of 110 vehicles built in 1941 for the fast fish trains operating from most ports to rush the catch to the cities.
Although similar to ordinary goods vans, most fish vans were classified as passenger stock to bring them under the stricter maintainance and examination procedures needed for high speed running. They therefore recieved passenger maroon livery.
They only became goods stock in 1965 by which time fish traffic was almost gone. Most were soon scrapped, mainly because of the smell.
They could often be seen attached to passenger trains to rush them on their way.
