BR exLMS Diagram2059 Fish Van.
Version2
Model and texture by Ian Macmillan.


75 of these wagons were built in 1941 using the same design as the banana and insulated vans.
They were classed as non passenger coaching stock, the reason being that they were used on fast goods trains that did not pass thru goods yards.
The passenger status indicated that they were to be examined and oiled by passenger train examiners who would normally ignore goods stock.
