20T 12ft wheelbased Tank Wagon.

Version 1
Released 9th Aug 2007

Model and textures by Ian Macmillan.

Class A tanks are used for petrol, kerosene (aviation fuel) and diesel fuel oil and are subject to strict safety regulations. They were colour coded with a silver or light grey tank and red solebars for easy recognition.
In steam or early diesel days a barrier wagon or wagons no less that 30ft were required between the loco and brake van and the tanks. They were usually marshalled in the middle of the train.

Class B tanks are used for Heavy oils such as used for heating or power station fuel and bitumen. 
To ease flow the oil was heated before loading and the tanks were lagged.
Because of the weight the tanks were smaller than the class A but the lagging made them the same size.

These 20ton tanks were introduced in the late 30s being an extended version of the RCH 14ton tank. They lasted until replaced by air braked tanks in the late 60s.
