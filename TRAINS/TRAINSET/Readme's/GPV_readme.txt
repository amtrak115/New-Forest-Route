RCH 1923 Gunpowder Vans.
Version 2
Released 20/10/10

Model by Ian Macmillan.

Prototype.
~~~~~~~~

The original RCH gunpowder van was based on the the GWR design with its distinctive rounded corners and was built by many companies in WW1.
The GWR changed to square corners in 1914 but it wasn't until 1923 that the RCH updated their design.
This had a 16ft 6in underframe and independant 2 shoe brake on each side.
The LMS and LNER built them in small numbers thru the years until 1939.
For use in WW2 the LMS, LNER and GWR built further batches.
The development of explosives in the war led to increased use in quarrying and mining as well as the goverments liking for wars led to BR building further batches.
The BR wagons differed by having 2 shoe Morton brakes.
Later most of the BR wagons and some of the earlier ones were converted to 4 shoe vacuum brakes.
Finally the only major change occured when BR built 40 vans with 10ft wheelbase and clasp vacuum brakes.

They continued in use until the early 70s when the were replaced by air braked vanwides. Many then passed to service stock where they were useful as oil stores.

4 different models are included.
An ex LNER van.
An exLMS van converted to Vacuum braked,
A BR unfitted version,
And a BR 10ft WB van.

Please note that no more than 5 loaded vans were allowed in a train and that they must not be marshalled in the same train as inflamable materials such as petrol.
