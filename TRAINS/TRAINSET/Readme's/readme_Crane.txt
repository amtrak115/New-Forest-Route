HISTORY
~~~~~~~
The Ransomes & Rapier 45 ton Steam Breakdown Cranes were designed just prior to WWII to be used during the anticipated damage to the public-way system during enemy air-raids. 16 were built, and they were used on all regions. BR eventually obtained some of them and they were in use until the mid 1980s. Several are preserved in the UK.

This red version is as based in Carlisle and Willesden in the 1960s, the photo I have shows it with
metal shrouds over the pistons and cable structure, probably due to improvements in Health & Safety issues
and added after the crane was built, however this model is as per the plans I have.

UPDATE
~~~~~~~~
A bug in the shape file for the match wagon which prevented it working with MSTSbin has been corrected.
I also found an extra close brackets  ")" in the crane file which prevented the brake and sound sections being read.
The crane has been given vacuum brakes which are apropriate for the period modelled.
Finally the match wagon and reliever have been changed from Handbrake only to vacuum and vacuum piped to allow the brake to work on vehicles marshalled behind.

This update has been uploaded by Ian Macmillan on behalf of the original author.
Any problems with the models should be addressed to me - preferably by posting on UKTS so others can benefit by the answers.
Permission to repaint or include on a CD or any other website should be addressed to the original author.
