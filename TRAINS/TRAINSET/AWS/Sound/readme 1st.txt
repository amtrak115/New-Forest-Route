			READ ALL OF THIS FIRST !!!!

Did you know that every time a signal changes, M.S.T.S plays a sound ?

Well this download uses this signal change sound to play a kind of a.w.s

"Why not use the real one" I here you cry.

Well after much surching the web and well just trying stuff, I have found out...
wait for it... There is not one to use, 

"But" you cry, "It say's in some of the s.m.s files
NOTE MISSING AWS ALARM so there must be one".

Well it looks like to me (anyway) a good eyedear that never happened (at this time anyway)

so here is the next best thing,

TO USE....
FIRST BACK UP YOUR ROUTE FOLDER..... this is a must I messed mine up once 
(not with this I must add) 

STEP 1 UNZIP THIS ZIP FILE TO A TEMP FOLDER YOU CAN FIND (LIKE YOUR DESKTOP)

STEP 2 PLAY BOTH OF THE WAV. FILES THAT CAME WITH THIS READ ME
note aws_bell_new.wav for new dmus,emus and locos
note aws_bell_old from a real class 43 h.s.t best used on s&c line that came with m.s.t.s
as some newer steam locos had aws. (if you can get a newer steam loco)
note but you can use which ever you like..

STEP 3 RENAME THE AWS BELL THAT YOU WISH TO USE TO AWS_BELL.WAV

STEP 4 GOTO YOUR TRAIN SIM ROUTES FOLDER E.G:-
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\ROUTES

STEP 5 OPEN THE ROUTE FOLDER THAT WISH TO ADD THE AWS SOUND TO E.G:- settle & carlisle
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\ROUTES\EUROPE1

STEP 6 OPEN THE SOUND FOLDER E.G:-
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\ROUTES\EUROPE1\Sound

STEP 7 FIND AND RENAME THE SIGNAL.SMS FILE TO SOMETHING LIKE SIGNAL_OLD.SMS

STEP 8 COPY THE SIGNAL.SMS FILE THAT CAME WITH THIS READ ME TO THE FOLDER WERE YOU
RENAMED THE SIGNAL.SMS TO SIGNAL_OLD.SMS (OR WHAT EVER YOU CALLED IT)

STEP 9 COPY THE YOU RENAMED WAV FILE (FROM STEP 3) TO THE FOLDER WERE YOU
RENAMED THE SIGNAL.SMS TO SIGNAL_OLD.SMS (OR WHAT EVER YOU CALLED IT) E.G:- settle & carlisle
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\ROUTES\EUROPE1

STEP 10 RUN TRAIN SIM DRIVE SOMETHING (ANYTHING) ON THE ROUTE YOU ADDED AWS TO 
AND (CRY ?) SEE IF IT WORKS


to remove aws. 2.0 follow the steps for aws 1.0

to remove aws. 1.0

simpley delete the signal.sms file you copyed to the route/sounds folder
and rename the old signal.sms file (now called signal_old.sms or what ever you called it)
back to signal.sms, then delete the aws_bell.wav file. aws 1.0 is then removed

NOTES
 
1).This will work on any route that has signals, color lights or semaphore

2).BUT IT WILL ALL WAY'S PLAYS A GREEN SOUND, I have not found a way of makeing it play
a yellow or red sound. 

3).Some times you will hear 2 bell rings. this is a signal changeing some were close to
your train. This may not happen in explore the route. But may happen in activerts that have 
trains comeing the other way and they are close as there signals change.
 
4).I know it's not that good but it adds to the feel of m.s.t.s (well i think so anyway)

5).I hope you like.....
