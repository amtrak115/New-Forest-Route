BR exSR Standard Vans.

Model ........Ian Macmillan.
Textures....Ian Macmillan.


Prototype.

The SR van was a development of a SECR van. It is readily identified by it's distinctive roof profile.
The first was 450 unfitted vans to Diagram 1428 followed by 526 with 8 shoe fitted brakes. Alongside these were 570 unfitted and 300 fitted to diagram 1429 using second hand wheels. All had 9ft wheelbase.
In 1935 the design changed to a 10ft wheelbase and given the diagram 1458. 2885 were built. All were fitted, some having SR lift link brake while other had Morton linkage.
About half way through the build the body changed to alternating 2 wide and two narrow planks.
In 1941 a wartime "austerity version appeared as D1455. These were unfitted but had the 2+2 planks. 1863 were built plus 650 for the GWR and 400 for the LMS.
Continuing wood shortages led in 1945 to a change to ply bodies as diagram 1952. This design continued into BR days. 1053 were built by the SR and a further 750 by BR
These were intended as unfitted but 250 were built with lift link brakes and most were converted to fitted by BR.

The newer vans lasted into the 70s

All in all a very non standard standard van.
