CONTENTS
~~~~~~~~
This pack consists 8 different types of Mk1 coach:

BG    Gangwayed Brake
BCK   Brake Corridor Composite
BSK   Brake Corridor Second
SK    Corridor Second
FK    Corridor First
CK    Corridor Composite
RMB   Restaurant Miniature Buffet
TSO   Tourist Second Open

NOTE:
~~~~~
'lite' versions of these coaches are also included in this download. This has reduced detail
and is specifically intended for use in loose consists and AI trains in order to improve frame rates.
Make sure you select the correct model when creating normal consists.

ALSO NOTE:
~~~~~~~~~~
These are now all vacuum braked.

AND ANOTHER NOTE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Three sets of numbers are supplied with these models, one for each regon of BR that used the maroon livery. 
The models actually use the file Numbers.ace so by copying and renaming one of the following files, you can
change from the default Eastern region numbering:

NumbersW.ace   - Western Region
NumbersM.ace   - Midland Region
NumbersE.ace   - Eastern Region (default)

ONE FINAL NOTE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The addition of yellow and red stripes above the windows to denote first class and dining areas came into
use during the life of the maroon livery. Initially maroon coaches did not have these stripes applied.
The models that use the same filenames as previous versions of these models do not have stripes. New models
with stripes are now included with '_stripe' appended to their filenames.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing any models, I suggest you make a copy of all the files in the 
\TRAINS\TRAINSET directory - failure to do this may result in a lengthy re-installation process.

Unzip all the files into a folder called TempUnzip

Double-click the file Mk1MaroonInstaller.v4.0.exe and follow the instructions.

You are now ready to create a consist containing this model by using the Activity Editor
supplied with Microsoft Train Simulator - the model will not be available in the simulator unless you do this.

Please be aware that this model may or may not be compatible with all the engines and rolling stock that you 
have available.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.

THANKS
