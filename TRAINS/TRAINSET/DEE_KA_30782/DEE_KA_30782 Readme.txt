THE MODEL

This model represents 30782 in the BR Brunswick Green livery which it carried from October 1949 to September 1962 when it was withdrawn. The 2nd BR tender totem was carried from May 1960. Sir Brian was a "Scotch" Arthur, so called because it was built by the North British Locomotive Company. It entered traffic in July 1925, and when it was withdrawn had covered 1,197,719 miles.



ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank Kieran Hardy for carrying out the essential fault-finding and independent testing of the model, which enabled problems to be resolved before uploading. Also I am grateful for his brilliant screenshots, which are so much better than anything I could manage.





Finally,I hope you enjoy this model. If you have any comments then please send me a pm or post on the UKTS Forums.
