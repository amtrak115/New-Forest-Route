These are reskins of Frank Sandwell's Great Western Class 2251.
My thanks to Frank for allowing the release of this and making all the tenders possible.

The City Of Truro cabview by Hans Nooyen is included. Many thanks to Hans for permission.

The GWR sound set (File ID: 6481) and Crew Alias (File ID: 7706) are required.

Note that some of the locos have the early Templecombe shedplate (82G) and some have the late one (83G). I believe the change was made in 1963.

3205 and 3215 have chain coupling, the rest are automatic.




2217	82E
3205	83G

Key: 
82E Bristol (Barrow Road)

NB: The AI locos call a .SMS file called #GWR-Manor-66-100-11.SMS in folder SteamSoundsOrgUK in Common.Sound. This has an error in that the number of triggers should be 47 not 45.

Open the file with a text editor or wordpad and search for the word Triggers, When you find a line like this :-

				Triggers ( 45

Change it to :-

				Triggers ( 47
