GWR 2251 Class 0-6-0 locomotive, first introduced in 1930 by C.B. Collett.  They were to replace the ageing 0-6-0 engines of Armstrong and Dean design for intermediate main line work, both passenger and goods duties. Some survived up to the mid sixties and one  example 3205 has been preserved. Some were coupled with ex- ROD 4000 gallon tenders. I have provided examples of both types of tenders.

Note that loco 2265 is set up for the ROD tender (the tender capacity is stored in the loco file rather than the tender file!!). Regardless of tender used, 2258 has 3500 gallons available and 2265 has 4000 gallons available.

Models by Frank Sandwell. Built and painted using 3DC.
