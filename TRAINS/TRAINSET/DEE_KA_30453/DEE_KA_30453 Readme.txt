THE MODEL

This model represents 30453 in the BR Brunswick Green livery which it carried from February 1950 to July 1961 when it was withdrawn. King Arthur was an "Eastleigh" Arthur, so called because it was built at Eastleigh Works. It entered traffic in February 1925, and when it was withdrawn had covered 1,606,428 miles.



ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank Kieran Hardy for carrying out the essential fault-finding and independent testing of the model, which enabled problems to be resolved before uploading. Also I am grateful for his brilliant screenshots, which are so much better than anything I could manage.





Finally,I hope you enjoy this model. If you have any comments then please send me a pm or post on the UKTS Forums.
