Brief Origins

During the 1930’s, the Southern Railway had many ageing freight locos and a newer replacement was needed but this was also in a period where route electrification was well underway and replacement steam locos were planned to be restricted in number. So a simple loco design was sought that would use as many off the peg components as possible. With this in mind the Q class was created using many fittings from the U and N Class locos. Like the U’s and N’s they were at first deemed to be sluggish and shared similar initial problems with the exhaust blast pipe arrangement. During the 1950’s some of them were rebuilt with Class 4 chimneys to improve their steaming and all were fitted with AWS. In the long term once this steaming problem was overcome, they proved reliable hard working engines that were in service until the final years of steam, the last being in 1965.  They were all allocated to service in the Western and Central divisions with only occasional forays to the Eastern Tonbridge Wells area. One member of the class was saved for preservation. No541 can be found at the Bluebell Railway though she is currently being undergoing a major rebuild.

HEADCODES

The model comes complete with 33 choices of headcodes which by changing a number on a line in the loco engfile will give you a different headcode display.

Open the engfile and look for a line that looks like

FreightAnim ( "..\\common.headcodes\\CCW_Q\\Q_Fittings_06.s" 0 3.0 0.0 )

This signifies that the headcode displayed is No6 on the linked list below. Change 06 to any number between 01 and 33 for a different code as listed this includes 22E and 22W which are divisional differences.

Please see here for headcodes used by the Southern Region section of British Railways :-
