Thank you for downloading these models
These wagons were classed as Brown Vehicles indicating they could be attached to passenger trains. There are  five variations incuding three bogie types,the O12 could double as a "Monster" type vehicle. They were designed to convey milk churns. Again these are high poly models primarily designed for the up coming sims, but, will still perform in MSTS thanks to Pauls great utility, Shape Fixer.
