King Arthur Class N15 4-6-0  30773 "Sir Lavaine"


This model requires Kim Durose's Cabfile - KDSchools.cvf. I believe it is still available on Trainsim.com, alternatively it can be found in UKTS File ID 20055 N15X 32329.  It was used with Kim's permission on this model,on condition that it remains freeware and no charge is made - it is essential that everyone observes this condition. 

The crew have been obtained from UKTS ID 7706.


With the exception of the crew, the contents of this file - DEE_KA_30781 - are the copyright of Danny Gilbert. January 2009.


The model has been tested prior to release, but any subsequent download and installation must be undertaken at your own risk. The model is Freeware and for personal use only and all files are for distribution by UKTS only. They must not be made available from any other website - or used in any other way - without my permission.

If you want to re-skin then go right ahead - I look forward to seeing them! The only condition is that a copy of this readme is included in the folder.

THE MODEL

This model represents 30773 in the BR Brunswick Green livery which it carried from September 1951 to February 1962 when it was withdrawn. The 2nd BR tender totem was carried from January 1960. Sir Lavaine was a "Scotch" Arthur, so called because it was built by the North British Locomotive Company. It entered traffic in July 1925, and when it was withdrawn had covered 1,296.365 miles.



ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank Kieran Hardy for carrying out the essential fault-finding and independent testing of the model, which enabled problems to be resolved before uploading. Also I am grateful for his brilliant screenshots, which are so much better than anything I could manage.



Finally,I hope you enjoy this model. If you have any comments then please send me a pm or post on the UKTS Forums.

UPDATED FILES FOLDER   Included in this folder are 3 files that can be used for updating the models 30777 and 30781. These files are provided for the following reasons:

1. To correct a slight "kick"  that occurs in the animation of a connecting rod.
2. To correct the facing direction of the BR totem  on the tender.

For 1. just add the respective shape file to the appropriate 30777 or 30781 Trainset folder and let it overwrite or replace the existing file.
For 2. Do the same for the .ace file, adding a copy to both 30777 and 30781 Trainset folders. As the tenders are identical, the same .ace file goes in each.
