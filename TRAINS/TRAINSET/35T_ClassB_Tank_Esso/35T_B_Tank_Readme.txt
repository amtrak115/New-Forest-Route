Released 20th Jan 2008

Traditionally, oil and petrol were distibuted from the refineries to small dealers and garage owners as single wagon loads in slow goods trains.
World war two saw a great increase in the number of wagons to supply airfields and miliary depots.

In the 50s, BR was trying to speed up traffic with fast fitted freights but the oil companies, with plenty of reasonably new but unfitted wagons available, were reluctant to modernise.

BR approached the wagon builders and together a tank wagon was designed with vacuum brakes and a long wheelbase suitable for 60mph running.
Esso was convinced to order the new wagons and BR also ordered some for sleeper creosote.

The improved service available to Esso finally convinced other companies to used the new design and the modernisation of the tank wagon finally was underway.

Three versions of the wagon were built.
The class A had a barrel 25ft 2in long and 7ft 3in diameter to carry petrol.
The class B had a shorter barrel of 22ft 6in to carry the heavier fuel oils while the creosote tank was 24ft 8in long but had a diameter of 6ft 6in.

A bitumin version soon followed. This had a smaller tank but was lagged making it similar to the class B.

The design was overtaken by the higher capacity 45T wagon from 1960 but, as the large companies updated, the wagons passed on to smaller companies and were used for a large variety of products.
Some were converted to air brakes and continue in use today.


Two versions of the wagon are included.
One is as originally built with Esso signs as freight animations.
A .wag file is included without the signs.

The other is in later unbranded condition.
