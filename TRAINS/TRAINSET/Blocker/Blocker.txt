Blocker
Replacement file by Ian Macmillan.


An invisible diesel with very low power.

Use it to block the player path in an activity.


The model is invisible but pressing Ctrl and numberpad + will show the bounding box.
No ace file is needed - it aliases to the global/textures folder.


This is model is based on the GP38 .eng file.
As such no restrictions are placed on this model but if you modify it in any way please rename it to avoid breaking existing activities.
