Lydbrook Junction 2 Stock
20t & 16t ( Toad ) Brakevans
Version 1.0 ( February 2011 )

3D Models built by Reg Furniss

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These 3D models have been built using TrainSim Modeler

These models are of the two " toad " brakevans that I found were allocated to the area.
A 16ton Lydbrook van in both GWR & BR liveries
A 20ton Lydney van in bothe GWR & BR liveries
Both vans have a passenger view ( press 5 )

Any suggestions of help or constructive comments welcome.
