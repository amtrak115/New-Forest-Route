Crew Animations for LMS CD Based on Paul Gausden's Crew Shapes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Beta


"Crew Aliases 1" (available from UKTS) must be installed for these Crew Animations to be used.  See the extracts for Paul Gausden's original readme files, at the end of the "Crew Aliases 1" readme file, for details of his original release of these crew shapes.  These shapes are used with his permission.



INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unzip all the files in this zip file to your TRAINSET/common.crew/LIB_1 folder.


USE
~~~


To add the various crew animations to additional locos the following "FreightAnim" line should be added to the "Wagon" section of the ,eng file (I suggest that this is added just before the "Adhesion" line).
