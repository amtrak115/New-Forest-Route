PROTOTYPE.
~~~~~~~~~~

Diagram 039 was for wagons with a tarpaulin bar. These were built with 4 shoe unfitted and 8 shoe fitted brakes but most of the 4 shoe wagons emerged with vacuum cylinders. The only change from the original LMS design was the removal of the top lip on the ends which fouled the sheet bar.
In the 60s most of the bars were removed.

The wagons became redundant in the 60s and were turned over to the engineers where they were used to carry ballast and spoil. Some lasted until the early 90s until replaced by air braked wagons.

The models come with various loads but if you look in the folder you will find additional loaded wagons.

These models may not be posted on any website or included on CD without written permission.
Please also obtain permission for repaints. This will usually be granted, I just want to avoid duplication.
