BR D44 Steel End Hybar 5 Plank Open Wagons

Model and Textures by Ian Macmillan.
Version 3 beefs up the brake gear and adds 3D springes and other minor tweeks.


PROTOTYPE.

~~~~~~~~~~
Diagrams 044 were built with 4 shoe unfitted and 8 shoe fitted brakes but most of the 4 shoe wagons emerged with vacuum cylinders.

Almost all the unfitted wagons soon recieved vacuum cylinders and many were given tarpaulin bars. 
In the 60s most of the bars were removed.

The wagons became redundant in the 60s and were turned over to the engineers where they were used to carry ballast and spoil. Some lasted until the early 90s until replaced by air braked wagons.

THE MODELS.
~~~~~~~~~~~

The models come with various loads but if you look in the folder you will find additional loaded wagons.

These models may not be posted on any website or included on CD without written permission.
Please also obtain permission for repaints. This will usually be granted, I just want to avoid duplication.
