William Adams designed these handsome locomotives for the London & South Western Railway, they were built in batches by outside contractors between 1882 & 1885. The first were built by Beyer Peacock & Robert Stephenson, these were recognisable by their short side tanks which held just 1,000 gallons. Later locos had 1,200 gallons capacity. There were other differences between the locos from different manufacturers.

They were used extensively on the suburban services from Waterloo, taking the place of various classes of Beattie locos. Later they found their way over the system & were used in the West Country.

Some were reboilered with Drummond boilers, some had Drummond chimneys fitted, apparently they didn't steam as well with these - I doubt anyone dared tell Drummond! 

Most of the class had been withdrawn by the late 1920s. Two of the locos were retained for the Axminster - Lyme Regis Branch which they worked until the early 60s, joined by a third which had been sold to the East Kent Railway & bought back by the Southern in 1946. This loco, LSWR 488, EKR 5, BR 30488 was bought by the Bluebell Railway & can be seen there.

The model is likely to be updated taking note of the work being done on engine physics at the moment.

To install this model with WinZip.

Install to your "MSTS directory"/lswr415 & install all of the files including blank.ace. Create a subdirectory /cabview & move scotsman.cvfinto it. I use a grey texture in place of the default blue, feel free to use it elsewhere - it's much smaller & more useful. Some files are common to other models only replace if these are more recent.

Still in Eastleigh Works are:-

T9 Class 4-4-0, narrow cab, with & without watertube boiler
F13 Class 4-6-0
700 Class 0-6-0
B4 Class 0-4-0T
