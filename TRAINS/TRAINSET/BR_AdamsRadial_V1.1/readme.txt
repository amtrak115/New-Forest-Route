BR ADAMS RADIAL No 30583

Original Model by Richard Osborne
Reskin by David Gibbons/longbow

V1.1 - eng file revised to fix front coupling and add fuel and water intakes

This is a reskin of Richard's Adams radial 4-4-2 tank into BR No 30583 as she
appeared in the 1950s. She was one of three survivors of the class retained to
work the tight curves of the Lyme Regis branch, and was withdrawn in 1961. The
reskin is not strictly accurate as No 30583 had longer tanks and other detail
differences from Richard's base model.

Also included are AI (#BR_AdamsRadial) and helper (##BR_AdamsRadial) versions,
both numbered as sister engine 30582 which also worked the branch at this time.
Use the helper version if you want a double-headed player consist.

The model is aliased to the default Scotsman cab and Stuart Williamson's
2-cylinder sound set, which must be pre-installed in your trainset folder.

An alternative eng file is included aliased to the 3DTS M7 cab: use this only
if you already have the 3DTS Swanage route installed.

The reskin uses a freight animation to apply the BR totems and other detail, so
you cannot add a loco crew.

Thanks to Richard for the original model and his permission to upload this
reskin.
