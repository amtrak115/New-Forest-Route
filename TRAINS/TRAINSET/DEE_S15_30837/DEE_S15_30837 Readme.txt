Maunsell S15 4-6-0  30837 fitted with AWS and "Schools" Class tender.

This model requires Kim Durose's Cabfile - KDSchools.cvf. I believe it is still available on Trainsim.com, alternatively it can be found in UKTS File ID 20733.  It was used with Kim's permission on this model,on condition that it remains freeware and no charge is made - it is essential that everyone observes this condition. 

The crew have been obtained from UKTS ID 7706.

With the exception of the Cabfile and crew, the contents of this file - DEE_S15_30837 - are the copyright of Danny Gilbert. February 2011.


The model has been tested prior to release, but any subsequent download and installation must be undertaken at your own risk. The model is Freeware and for personal use only and all files are for distribution by UKTS only. They must not be made available from any other website - or used in any other way - without my permission.

RESKINS 


If you want to re-skin then go right ahead - I look forward to seeing them! The only condition is that a copy of this readme is included in the folder.

My texture mapping is not very good - in fact it's probably quite confusing as textures have been obtained and modified from previous models. To identify the correct textures for a part it is recommended that you use Paul Gausden's ShapeView. Click on View and then Textures and this provides a full listing. Removing the tick from any box identifies the applicable parts in that texture.

THE MODEL

The model represents 30837 in plain Black BR livery, clean ex-works condition. 30837 was the last S15 in BR service. It was fitted with a Schools Class tender from 30912 "Downside" in June 1962 and kept this until finally withdrawn in January 1966. 30837 was intially withdrawn in the autumn of 1965, but was then given a minor overhaul and clean in preparation for two Farewell Rail tours in January 1966.

There were 45 locomotives in the S15 class. Designed by Urie but later modified by Maunsell, the first batch was completed between 1920-21 (BR numbers 30496-30515), the second batch in 1927-28 (30823-30837) and the third batch in 1936 (30838-30847).

They were essentially freight locomotives, but it wasn't unusual to see them on local passenger services.


HEAD CODE DISK INDICATORS

Disk indicators have been provided,numbered top down (then left to right facing the smokebox) from 1-6. To change disks just CUT the appropriate "live" or "dead" disk from the respective sub-folders and then PASTE in the main loco folder. Remember the Trainset file must have 6 in no disk.ace files included - "live" or "dead".


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank Kieran Hardy for carrying out the essential fault-finding and independent testing of the model, which enabled problems to be identified and resolved before uploading. Also I am grateful for his brilliant screenshots, which are so much better than anything I could manage.

I would also like to thank Rick Gibb (1crick14a) for writing the .eng and .wag files - a vital part of any MSTS model and such an improvement over my tentative efforts.




Finally,I hope you enjoy this model. If you have any comments then please send me a pm or post on the UKTS Forums.
