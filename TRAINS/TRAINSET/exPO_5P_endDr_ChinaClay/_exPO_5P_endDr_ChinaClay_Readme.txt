BR exPO 5P End Door China Clay Wagon.

Version 2

Released : 15-2-2017

Model      : Ian Macmillan.
Textures : Ian Macmillan.

China clay is used in the pottery industry to give the glossy white shine. It was used not only for kitchenware but also for tiles and bathroom furniture. You will probably sit on china clay some time today!
It was also used to give the gloss to paper and in the chemical industry.

The clay was produced in powder form but was kept slightly damp to keep down the dust. This made it difficult to unload and so end tipping wagons were used. It also had to be protected from the rain and the wagons were sheeted except for short runs. To keep the wagon inside dry they were also sheeted when empty. They could be unloaded by the end door without removing the sheet.

About half the traffic was exported via Cornish ports but the remainder was sent all over the country.
Their specialised use let them avoid takeover by the goverment in WW2 but this created complaints when the coal trade was payed compensation and BR were forced to take them over. They lasted until replaced by the well known clayhoods in the mid 50s.
Some remained in internal use.

Use the sheeted versions for normal consists and the unsheeted and emptywagons in sidings.
