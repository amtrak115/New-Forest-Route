BR Modified Hall No. 7903 'Foremarke Hall'

Installation: Simply unzip the the Trainset and Consists folders into the Trains folder of your main MSTS folder, using Winzip.

This loco requires Stuart Williamson's GWR Loco Sound Set to be installed.

Thanks to Refman for allowing me to reskin his Modified Hall model.
Thanks to Richard Gibb for making the ENG file.
Thanks to Lew PRice for letting me include his GWR cabview.

The Loco has proper GWR brakes, and will need the small ejector open to release the brakes. The ejector should be shut once the brakes are released, or you will lose steam.

The loco is for personal use only, and must not be redistrubuted without the author's permission.
