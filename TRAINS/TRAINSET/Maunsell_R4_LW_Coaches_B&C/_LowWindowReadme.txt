The first trully Maunsell coaches were based on the LSWR Ironside.
They had doors to every compartment to speed loading at suburban stations and a deep panel above the windows.
First were 3coach sets for the London to West of England route.
The brake coaches had 4 compartments and guards duckets and, to keep them within the 9ft width, the entire luggage section was recessed to 8ft7in.
The high van space made them compatable with other companies stock and most found their way onto inter-regional trains and the S&D.

Most of the remaining first orders were loose coaches including BCKs for the numerous West Country branches
 
From 1929 the hight of the corridor windows was increase to cant rail hight. This gave the coaches their distinctive look.

Electrification gradually reduced their numbers but most lasted into the early 60s.
