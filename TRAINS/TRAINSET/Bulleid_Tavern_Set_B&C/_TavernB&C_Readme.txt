Bulleid Tavern Cars.
BR Blood & Custard Livery

Model......Ian Macmillan
Textures...Ian Macmillan

In 1949 8 kitchen buffet cars and their accompanying dining cars were introduce - the notorious Tavern cars.

The idea was to create an "olde worlde" inn on wheels by painting  the sides with brick courses and oak beams.
The restaurant car had seating facing inward along the coach side.Only the top window light was fitted meaning the diners could not see out.

After onlya few months in service the restaurant car was rebuilt with conventional windows and seats and the the Buffet repainted in standard livery.

They were used on the west of England route to Exeter

This pack contains the two coach set as introduced and as rebuilt and repainted.
