In 1949 8 kitchen buffet cars and their accompanying dining cars were introduce - the notorious Tavern cars.

The idea was to create an "olde worlde" inn on wheels. The new BR livery of crimson and cream had been introduced so why not paint the crimson as imitation brick and paint oak beams on the cream?. Inside was more fakery.
The restaurant car had seating facing inward along the coach side.Only the top window light was fitted meaning the diners could not see out. The idea was to increase the throughput of passengers but the gloomy atmosphere meant customers didn't come at all.

Two sets were used on the Atlantic Coast Express while three were sent to the LMR for use on the Master Cutlet and the White Rose. The remaining sets went to the Eastern Region for the Norfolkman and the South Yorkshireman.
There followed a stream of complaints and takings plummeted.
In late August after less than three months they were returned to the Southern.
In early 1950 the coaches were sent to the works. The Tavern cars got off with a repainted but the restuarant cars were rebuilt with conventional seating and windows.

The tavern sets settled down to a normal existance on West of England expresses and were repainted in BR green from 1957.
Between mid 1959 and 1960 the tavern cars were rebuilt and the seating area opened out with additional windows but the tavern sign was removed. They remained in service until 1965 with the last being withdrawn in 1968.
