The Real Thing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The original Drummond design for the LSWR was later superheated.  The model shows one of the class in its final form with extended smokebox and stovepipe chimney in its final BR black livery. 

Driving
~~~~~~~
Like many pre-grouping locomotives these engines were fitted with lever reverse.
This provided a number of fixed notches in each direction.
Drivers would normally select a cut off before starting from a station and try to avoid changing it between stops.
For most purposes a cut off of around 30% will suffice. 
(You may need a higher cut off if you know there is a major climb ahead!) 
Start by gradually opening the regulator as far as possible, without slipping.
As the engine gains speed gradually reduce the regulator opening to conserve steam and fuel.


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This locomotive requires the HR Ben/Barney cab view, 2-cylinder generic sound set and loco crew which must be downloaded and installed separately.


Version 2.0 - includes animated valve gear.

WARNING: It is not recommended that you delete these files once installed.
